With minimal changes (the\n exports stuff) it should work on any JS platform.</p>\n\n<p>This file implements some AST processors.  They work on data built\n by parse-js.</p>\n\n<p>Exported functions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>ast_mangle(ast, options) -- mangles the variable/function names\n in the AST.  Returns an AST.</p></li>\n<li><p>ast_squeeze(ast) -- employs various optimizations to make the\n final generated code even smaller.  Returns an AST.</p></li>\n<li><p>gen_code(ast, options) -- generates JS code from the AST.  Pass\n true (or an object, see the code for some options) as second\n argument to get \"pretty\" (indented) code.</p>\n\n<p>-------------------------------- (C) ---------------------------------</p>\n\n<pre><code>                  Author: Mihai Bazon\n                &lt;mihai.bazon@gmail.com&gt;\n              http://mihai.bazon.net/blog\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Distributed under the BSD license:</p>\n\n<p>Copyright 2010 (c) Mihai Bazon <a href=\"&#x6D;&#97;&#x69;&#x6C;&#116;&#x6F;:&#x6D;&#105;&#x68;&#x61;&#105;&#x2E;&#x62;&#97;&#122;&#x6F;&#110;&#64;g&#x6D;&#97;i&#108;.&#x63;&#x6F;m\">&#x6D;&#105;&#x68;&#x61;&#105;&#x2E;&#x62;&#97;&#122;&#x6F;&#110;&#64;g&#x6D;&#97;i&#108;.&#x63;&#x6F;m</a></p>\n\n<p>Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions\nare met:\nRedistributions of source code must retain the above\n     copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n     disclaimer.\nRedistributions in binary form must reproduce the above\n     copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n     disclaimer in the documentation and/or other materials\n     provided with the distribution.</p>\n\n<p>THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER “AS IS” AND ANY\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.
